| <b>A</b>. Any user can be registered, logged in, logged out and password can be reset. | The user can login with a dynamic login (using DB). The user can log out; then the session is removed and any cache is deleted. A user can be registered through a registration form with a CAPTCHA-like functionality to prevent spam. A check is performed to see whether a user has registered before using the same email address. The password of a user can be reset using a reset link and confirmation link (in the reset passwordemail). The password is saved in the database in an encrypted form using a form of hash/salt encryption method. A user can edit its own information (e-mail address, name, password) after being logged in. A confirmation e-mail is sent when the user edits his own information to the old and new e-mail address. A user has a role (user, administrator or superadministrator). A user can only edit information of his own user profile. An administrator can edit information of other users. A superadministrator can create, edit or delete other administrators and users. An administrator can log in on behalf of a user. | 10 |
| <b>B</b>. The application can be used to query records of users. | The application can be used to do an extensive search query on ‘name’, ‘emailaddress’, ‘registration date’ using a LIKE operator in the database query. Basic techniques (e.g. mysqli_real_escape_string or PDO) are used to prevent SQL injection / code injection. Basic techniques are used to prevent spamming / DoS attacks on the system (timeouts, CAPTCHA, maximum number of queries per minute). Techniques are used to prevent data miners to retrieve the database. | 10 |
| <b>C</b>. The application is robust, the code is expandable and readable for non-programmers. | The application is completely written in object oriented code. Code comments are used for every line of (trivial) code to explain the inner workings of the application. The MVC (or equally sophisticated) design pattern is used to structure the code in several code layers with their own responsibilities. Every class has a constructor, getters and setters. A modifier and type hinting is used to define access to properties. Class constants are used when necessary. Interfaces and/or inheritance structures are used to synchronize the application with its conceptual architecture design. Helper and debug classes are provided to speed up the development process. | 15 |
| <b>D</b>. The application prevents errors from occurring and catches unforeseen errors using exception handling. | Exception handling is used for catching different types of exceptions. Almost all errors are prevented before occurring (e.g. by user input validation). | 15 |
| <b>E</b>. The application uses forms, sessions and cookies to transfer information between pages to insert, update or delete records of a certain entity. | The application uses forms with the correct HTTP method: GET to retrieve information, POST to insert entities, PUT to update entities and DELETE to remove entities. The application provides at least one form to upload images using a encoding type for multi-part form data. Cookies are used to store trivial information. Sessions are used to store non-trivial information. The contents of cookies and sessions are encrypted or not readable. A check is performed to ensure that access to certain pages is restricted if the session is not set correctly. The user has the possibility to delete all sessions and cookies containing personal information in accordance with privacy laws (GDPR). | 15 |
| <b>F</b>. The application re-uses code whenever possible using methods / functions. | The application code is written in methods that are part of classes. Code is re-used when possible in a logical and efficient manner. Return types are consistently used throughout the application. Data types are used in an explicit way (by initializing before using). Methods are bound to a local scope and do not use global variables. | 10 |
| <b>G</b>. The application uses arrays to temporarily store information within an application page. | The application uses arrays outside and inside of the class / method scope to organize multi-dimensional strings or collections of information. Arrays are almost always used in an associative manner. When possible, objects are used as arrays. Casting of arrays is used to speed up the development process and to maintain processing speed. | 5 |
| <b>H</b>. The application uses a database connection (e.g. MySQL) to synchronize data between the application and database. | The application uses a database connection. The database connection can be used to create, retrieve, update, delete (CRUD) entities within the application. The database connection uses MySQLi to handle queries. A singleton (or similar pattern) is used to create one database connection that is used throughout the application. The database connection uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. (INNER/OUTER) JOIN queries are used to merge multiple tables in one query. The application uses transactions that group queries. Transactions are rolled back in its entirety if an error occurs. | 15 |
| <b>I</b>. The application provides an API to allow other applications to communicate with the application implemented by the student. | The application provides a possibility for other systems to interact with the application [API server] and an authentication system is implemented for which a user can manage API access using the application. | 5 |
| <b>J</b>. The application is approachable through an publicly accessible URL, the URL is handed in through Blackboard, the code is handed in through Blackboard. | The application is approachable through an publicly accessible URL, the URL is handed in through Blackboard, the code is handed in through Blackboard. | conditional |
